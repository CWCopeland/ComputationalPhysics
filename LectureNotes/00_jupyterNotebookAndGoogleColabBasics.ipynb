    "### What is python?\n",
    "\n",
    "Python is a programming language which is very commonly used in physics, engineering, and in industry. It is an interpreted high-level language which focusses on code readability. There are thousands of external python packages which extend python's capabilities and make it very useful for calculations and plotting (among other things).\n",
    "\n",
    "Documentation: https://docs.python.org/3.10/index.html\n",
    "\n",
    "Example scientific package: https://numpy.org/\n",
    "\n",
    "### What is a Jupyter Notebook?\n",
    "\n",
    "A Jupyter Notebook is a web application (it opens in your browser) which allows you to write, save, and share interactive documents which contain text, live code (you can actually run the code within the browser), plots, images, and equations. Jupyter supports three default code languages (Julia, Python, and R) which is where its name comes from. You may also see these notebooks refered to as ipython notebooks but this is a somewhat depricated term. We will focus on python in this course.\n",
