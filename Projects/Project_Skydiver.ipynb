The bisection method is a search algorithm that finds when a given function returns a desired value, within a certain tolerance. It is significantly more computationally efficient than a brute force method (i.e., testing every value until you find the one you want).\n",

That is, you start by defining the upper and lower bounds of the range of values you will be searching over—call them the **ceiling** and the **floor**. In practice, it's helpful to choose values that are much higher and lower than your expected values, since some extra padding either way will not significantly affect the speed of the search.\n",

If the returned value is too high, you know the actual value you are looking for will be below the middle, and you set the **ceiling** equal to the **middle** (lower the ceiling). You then repeat this process with the new **floor** and **ceiling**, until the values of the **floor** and **ceiling** are very close together. Then, depending on what you are after, the final value of the floor or ceiling will be your final awnser.\n",
